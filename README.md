<h2><a class="anchor" id="overview"></a>Overview</h2>
The Easy Scanner App is a Flutter-based prototype that allows users to scan documents using their mobile deviceâ€™s camera. Inspired by CamScanner/TapScanner, it provides a lightweight framework for capturing images, cropping them to document size, and preparing them for export as PDF files.<br>

The project currently includes a functional UI with key screens (camera capture, crop view, document list), basic navigation, and integration with Flutter dependencies for further expansion.<br>

<h2><a class="anchor" id="problem"></a>Problem</h2>

- Implementing smooth camera integration across Android devices.<br>
- Allowing users to crop scanned images to document boundaries.<br>
- Enabling multipage scanning and merging into a single PDF.<br>
- Providing a clean, minimal interface with responsive design.<br>
- Handling file storage, permissions, and sharing securely.<br>

<h2><a class="anchor" id="tools"></a>Tools</h2>

- Flutter & Dart: Core framework and language for cross-platform development.<br>
- Android SDK: For native integrations and debugging.<br>
- VS Code / Cursor IDE: For coding, testing, and project setup.<br>
- pubspec.yaml: For dependency management.<br>

<h2><a class="anchor" id="key-things"></a>Key Things</h2>

- Camera Integration (prototype): Ability to capture images from within the app.<br>
- Cropping Tool (basic skin): Placeholder UI for cropping documents.<br>
- PDF Conversion (planned): Export scanned images into PDF format.<br>
- Multi-Page Support (planned): Scan and compile multiple pages into one document.<br>
- Clean UI: Built with Flutter widgets, ensuring modularity and responsiveness.<br>

<h2><a class="anchor" id="recommendations"></a>Recommendations</h2>

- Keep UI modular (separate screens & widgets).<br>
- Use image_cropper and pdf packages for production-ready scanning features.<br>
- Implement error handling for camera permission and file saving.<br>
- Test across multiple Android versions for compatibility.<br>

<h2><a class="anchor" id="future-enhancements"></a>Future Enhancements</h2>

- Full Cropping Functionality: Add responsive, draggable crop box.<br>
